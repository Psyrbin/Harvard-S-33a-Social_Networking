The application is a social networking site.
Users have their personal pages where they can provide personal information, post something or delete existing post. Other users will be able to leave their comments under posts.
If you are on the page that belongs to a different user, you will see the "send message" button that will bring you to the dialogue with selected user. There you will be able to write messages and read messages written to you.
Clicking the "your messages" button on the left of the screen will bring you to the page where you will see all users who had written you or had received from you any messages and the last message in each conversation.
If a message has grey background, it means that it has not yet been read. When user enters conversation page, all unread messages in this conversation to the user are considered read.
"Search" button allows you to search for users by their names.
